# ModelUtil.cs

This script contains some base structure for 3d model progress.

## VectorMultiNumF

This structure is used to store dynamic num in a vector. It provide some useful method for mathmatic, such as 

```
float CosDistance(VectorMultiNumF a,VectorMultiNumF b)
```

```
 // second Normal Form: 
 // in Geometrically : Second Normal form is equal to distance from origin to vector
 public static float magnitude(VectorMultiNumF a)
```

```
public static float Dot(VectorMultiNumF a, VectorMultiNumF b)
```

```
public static bool checklegality(VectorMultiNumF a, VectorMultiNumF b)
```

There are useful!
